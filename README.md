# wxWebMap
A C++ library enabling web maps in desktop applications (Windows, Linux, MacOS). 

## wxWidgets
The library is based on ```wxWidgets``` and the web map is displayed using a ```wxWebView``` window.

## leafletjs
The map functionality is implemented using ```leafletjs```. ```Leafletjs javascript``` snippets to e.g. add a marker to a map are executed by calling e.g. ```wxWebMap::AddMapObject```.
